# Classroom Assistant Application Version 2

---

## Project Description

--- 

This project is an expansion of a previous Java-based project of mine. In this version of the project, I have completely redesigned the code, utilizing React for the front-end and Rust for the back-end. I used Tauri, a framework toolkit for building cross platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more, with a Rust back-end.

## Purpose

Besides the purpose of improving a previous project of mine, this project provides a valuable opportunity to explore learn new concepts. For instance, I'm learning about the integration between front-end and back-end components of an application, despite them using different programming languages. Additionally, Im delving into Rust, familiarizing myself with the syntax while managing a MongoDB database and learning how it organizes data into collections and documents.

## Currently I am working on...

<h3>The Classes Page</h3>

- Ensuring the buttons invoke functions within the Rust back-end properly.

- Developing the back-end functions to be able to access MongoDB and create new classes and add new students.
